<p style="padding-top: 60px;">
    This game is a combination of minesweeper and cricket. There are 11 fielders placed randomly in the grid, and your aim is to maximise the runs scored in 1 minute without getting all-out.
    <br>
    Go to <a href="./settings.html">settings</a> and select your Grid Size and number of Wickets.
    Now move on to <a href="./game.html">the game</a> and have fun.
</p>

<h2><u>The Cells</u></h2>

<p>
    <img src="../images/tutorial.png" width="200" height="200">
    Right click to reveal a cell. The cell can be either a fielder or a number.
    <br>
    You can also left click a cell to place a flag on it if you suspect it is a fielder. This doesn't confirm your suspicions but prevents loss by misclicks.
    <br> <br>
    If it's a fielder, you lose a wicket.
    <br>
    If it's a number instead, it denotes the total number of fielders present in the 8 cells which are adjecent to it. Here, the number is 3. Hence there are exactly 3 fielders in the surrounding 8 cells.

</p>
<br> <br>

<h2><u>The Streak</u></h2>

<p>
    The faster you play, the greater is the rate of increase of your score.
    <br> <br>
    You must reveal a cell within 1 second of last reveal to maintain your streak.
</p>

<br> 

<h2><u>The End</u></h2>

<p>
    The game ends if either your time runs out, you reveal all the non-fielder cells or you get all-out.
    <br> <br>
    Your final score is the sum of runs scored in each wicket.
